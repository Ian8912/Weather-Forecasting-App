# WeatherLink

This is a **weather app** project created for our software engineering course. Group members include **Ian Lingo**, **Nicholas Esteves**, **Taj Telesford**, **Anthony Rojas**, and **Ethan Perez**. This project's main goal is to have a functional app that tends to all the user's needs while embedding features that enhances the user experience. Our main target audience is anyone who owns a smartphone and/or computer that plans to use a weather app. We believe that the weather apps that currently exist are insightful and visually appealing, but we believe that there are features that are missing that could better inform the user when it comes to the weather. We hope to create an app that people can love and appreciate.
